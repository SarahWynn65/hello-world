# hello-world
General introductory work

Hello! I'm a stay at home mum with a rather old bachelor's in Computer Science. 
The kids are about to leave home, and I need some intellectual stimulation. 
I'm hoping to get back into the computing world, which I absolutely loved before I gave up my career to bring up a couple of the members of the next generation.
